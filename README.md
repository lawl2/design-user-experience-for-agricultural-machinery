# Design an UX for farm tractor

This team project aims to simulate and design an interface for agricultural machinery

## Context studies

Monitor represents pricipal elemtns of farm tractor's driver, regulating working parameters and controlling tractor status

Thanks to the help of many personas developped from different interviewed people, studying also the possible working and interface scenarios and looking at the insights needed we also went into the gemba in order to do not make any hypothesis, to collect data and also find possible problematics.

## Concept

In the current context, interfaces in the agricultural sector do not in many cases allow efficient interaction with the system, we therefore want to improve the accessibility of the interface by focusing on multi-interaction and simplification of user actions.
The design of a voice assistant and an analogue command will allow an improvement in multiple interaction, and will also lead to a simplification of user actions assisted by the use of shortcuts, widgets, routines and a streamlined and efficient design.
The improvement in accessibility will guarantee multi-level customization to the interface and will also allow optimization of the visibility of parameters useful to the user.

## Monitor selection

The 12-inch version was adopted as the solution, the body was completely redesigned, with the inclusion of the analogue control. The contours of the screen have been made thinner for reasons of size and visibility inside the cabin, but also of design, in fact the thickness of these has been set at 1 cm, with a useful reduction in size.
The choice of a larger monitor than the previous one was influenced by the need to increase the visibility of icons and screens.

### CAD design

Two possible solutions were evaluated: 

- Central nutton

- Side button

### Tecnomatix Jack

Thanks to the help of [Tecnomatix Jack](https://resources.sw.siemens.com/it-IT/download-tecnomatix-jack-student-download) and the collision detection instruments we define the good position of the monitor and its analog button

### CAD monitor stand design

Thanks to SolidWorks we simulate the regulation of monitor stand
